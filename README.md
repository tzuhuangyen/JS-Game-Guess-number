The code provided is written in JavaScript and 
sets up a game where the user needs to guess a secret number between 1 and 20. 
It includes logic to check if the user's guess is correct or not, 
update the score, display messages indicating whether the guess is too high or too low, 
and handle restarts. 
Additionally, the code keeps track of the highest score achieved even when the game is restarted.
